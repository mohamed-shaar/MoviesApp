# MoviesApp
In the MainActivity.java, the https://www.themoviedb.org/ api key is removed from 2 functions loadPopularMovies() and loadTopRatedMovies().
Sign up for an account on https://www.themoviedb.org/, request an api key and place it there for the project to work.

A java class "GridSpaceItemDecoration" and function in MainActivity.java dptopx() were given to me by the session instructor.
